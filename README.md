# Golang 
## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Introduction

In this repo I will store all my studies of the Go language and common data structures and algorithms implementations.

### How to run

Each folder represents a algorithm/data structure, with its implementation, a basic explanation and tests. 

```bash
# Running tests
$ go test ./...

# Running specific test
$ go test ./bubbleSort
```
