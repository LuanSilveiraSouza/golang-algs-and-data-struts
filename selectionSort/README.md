Selection Sort is a algorithm that sorts based on the smallest element. It runs through the array in each cycle, selecting the smallest item contained. In the end, it swaps positions between this smallest item and the current item, dividing the array in a sorted part in the left of current index and unsorted part in the right of current index.
