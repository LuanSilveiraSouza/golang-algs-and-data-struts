Merge Sort is a classification algorithm that uses the Divide and Conquer strategy, having solid performances even in its worst scenarios.
It consists of continuously separating the input matrix down to its smallest fraction (in other words, breaking the matrix into a matrix for each of the elements) and recursively merging two neighboor matrices into the final ordered matrix.

#### Complexity 
##### Worst Cases: O(n log n)
##### Medium and Best Cases: O(n log n)
