## Stack

Stack is a List that works in a strict way of pushing and popping items. It uses the concept of LIFO (Last in, first out) or FILO (First in, last out) to manage its items. The most common operations used with stacks are the Push() and Pop() of items, as so the Top() function that returns the element in last position of the stack.
