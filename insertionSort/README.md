Insertion Sort, as the name says, is a sorting algorithm that uses a insertion mecanism, putting one element per cycle in its correct order. It runs through all the array and for each element, it returns back until it reaches a element that is lower than it, putting it in its correct place. If it reaches the first element, it means that this element is the current lowest element, so it's placed in the beginning.

##### Best Cases: O(n)
